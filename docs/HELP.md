# Taktbuch help

Taktbuch tracks your time account, vacation and activities. Everything stays in your browser, nothing is sent to a server. This help is part of the file and works offline.

## The day in brief

On **Today** you enter start and end. The break is deducted automatically until you enter one for the day yourself. The **time account** is the sum of all days: hours worked minus target.

- Vacation, public holiday, sick leave and time off in lieu do not change the account, because the day's target counts as met.
- Hours on a day off count as extra work and raise the account. The app points this out on the day.
- Future days without times count as plan and do not burden the account.

## Activities and timer

Under **Activities** you log what you worked on: from to or duration, plus category, type, system, project number and topic. The timer starts an activity that keeps running until you stop it.

- When you enter a topic, category, type and system are suggested from the latest entry with the same topic (only empty fields are filled).
- After "Add" the fields are cleared.
- Which columns you see is set under Settings, Recording.

## Week and month

In the **week** you change times directly in the table. The weekly total works like the account: half vacation days (24 Dec and 31 Dec) only count with half the target if you work that day.

The **month** shows all days as a calendar. With the period tool you set several days at once to vacation, time off in lieu, business trip or a work location.


## Calendar: plan vacation and time off

In the **Calendar** pick a brush (vacation, half vacation, time off in lieu, business trip) and click or drag across days. A second click on a marked day removes it. At the top you see entitlement, taken, planned and remaining vacation, below it the course over the year.

- Expiry and carry-over to the long-term account follow the rules under Settings, Vacation and account.
- If the planning would make hours of the time account expire because of the cap, the calendar shows a warning.

## Reports and salary

**Reports** shows monthly and yearly tables, breakdowns by category, type and system and (if switched on) work location and business trips for your tax return. This is a plain count, not a tax calculation.

**Salary** shows the salary overview with pay rise and payday.


## Settings overview

- **Working time:** daily target (changes from a date), break rule, state for public holidays.
- **Vacation and account:** vacation days, 24 Dec and 31 Dec, expiry, long-term account, cap. Changes apply from a date, earlier periods keep their rules. The job change wizard starts here.
- **Salary:** inputs for the salary view and the payday.
- **Recording:** activity columns, work location, overtime payout, business trip (customer and place).
- **General:** display and rounding of times.
- **Data:** backup, restore, Excel import, automatic backup, version and updates.

## Job change

When you change jobs in the middle of a year, start the wizard under Settings, Vacation and account. It asks for the date, vacation days, vacation left until year end, starting values for account and long-term account and the new target. The old job counts pro rata in half months (1st to 15th = half a month), rounded up to half days. Everything before stays unchanged.


## Work location, payout and business trip

These are off by default and switched on under Settings, Recording. **Work location** counts office and home office per day, including split days (office first then home office or the other way round, with a switch time). **Payout** deducts paid-out overtime from the account. For a **business trip** you enter customer and place.


## Backup and updates

Your data lives only in this browser. Save a backup regularly under Settings, Data. In Chrome and Edge you can pick a folder there for the **automatic backup** (for example in OneDrive). Taktbuch keeps the latest files and leaves other files in the folder alone.

When an **update** is available a notice appears at the top. "Install" overwrites the file you currently have open, after confirmation. Save a backup first, do not rename the file and do not move it.


## Language, report a problem

Switch between German and English at the top right. Under Settings, Data you find "Report a problem / send a request". It opens your mail program with prefilled text (version, browser, active switches). Nothing is sent automatically and no data from the app.
